**Living Free** is an inpatient substance abuse recovery program for adult men seeking recovery from substance abuse and addiction. The facility is located in Hartselle, Alabama and was founded and operated by Rendell Drummond.

**Living Free** utilizes a social model of recovery. Men enrolled in the recovery program learn to become accountable for their actions. They actively participate in the community process of accountability and learn to appropriately deal with consequences for inappropriate behavior. During the community process the men learn to hold their peers accountable with love, dignity, and respect. Men “give back” to the recovery program by providing their own cleaning, light maintenance repairs, laundry, food service, and lawn care services. They are taught independent living skills and learn to become responsible for their own personal care as well as caring for their own living environment.

This program is for adult men only. They must understand that the primary focus of **Living Free** is recovery first. Other life issues will be addressed in the latter phases of the program when they have a sufficient amount of sobriety time to clearly and effectively deal with other issues. Introduction of other life issues too early in the recovery process could sabotage the overall recovery efforts.

**Living Free** is a group living facility. Men share living spaces with their peers. Having valuables and large sums of money is discouraged as they are the mens’ responsibility for safekeeping. There is no onsite medical clinic. All medical emergencies are handled by the local hospital and/or voluntary medical personnel. **Living Free** is not financially responsible for medical bills incurred by clients during their enrollment in the program. All medical bills incurred by clients, including prescriptions, is the client’s responsibility.

The overall length of the program is between six months to one year. Potential clients should commit to completing the entire program uninterrupted and make plans for care of personal business prior to program admission.

In order to receive services at **Living Free** applicants must be:

- Male
- 18 years of age or older
- Able to provide self care daily without assistance
- Have or be able to obtain a social security card, birth certificate, and photo ID.
- These items can be obtained after arrival at cost to the client.
- Willing to abide by all rules, regulations, and policies set forth by staff of the facility
